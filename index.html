<p>
This is where you write.
<p>
In between each paragraph, just use those p tags.
I like writing one sentence per line here.
But it will all just come out as one paragraph.
<p>
You get used to writing inbetween the tags, and just ignoring them.
It's so much easier than using a collection of other tools to make HTML.
Just write inside an HTML file directly! 
So much simpler.
<p>
You can <a href="about.html">link to other pages like this</a>.
<p>
Or insert an image like this:
<img src="https://1drv.ms/i/s!Ai1nKpJg4M3Bhi7-Lr_X9Y9yPf1A?e=QJdjaO">
<p>
That's it!
